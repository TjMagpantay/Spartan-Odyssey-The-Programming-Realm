We are the researchers and developers from BSIT 2203, second-year IT students at Batangas State University. We have developed a game, "Spartan Odyssey: The Programming Realm," designed to enhance users' programming skills efficiently while providing entertainment on their electronic devices. Through this game, players can learn, grow, enjoy, and enhance their abilities and knowledge in a constructive way without feeling bored or discontented.

"Spartan Odyssey: The Programming Realm" offers tools to help players improve their problem-solving abilities and programming skills while maintaining their interest in learning. Additionally, we believe that our educational game can inspire first-year IT students to pursue further education and studies in the field of game development.
