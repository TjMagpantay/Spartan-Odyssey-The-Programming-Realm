## IT 222 - FINAL PROJECT

## Introduction
Sup! We are second-year IT students  researchers and developers from BSIT 2203 at Batangas State University . We developed "Spartan Odyssey: The Programming Realm," a game that will help players improve their programming skills while also providing entertainment on their electronic devices. This game allows players to learn, grow, enjoy, and improve their abilities and knowledge in a positive way without becoming bored or dissatisfied.

"Spartan Odyssey: The Programming Realm" provides tools to help players improve their problem-solving and programming skills while remaining interested in learning. Furthermore, we believe that our educational game will motivate first-year IT students to pursue additional education and studies in the field of game development.
